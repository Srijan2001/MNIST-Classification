# MNIST-Classification
Built a deep convolutional neural network in Keras which classifies the digits in the MNIST dataset. The model was trained on a GPU on Google Colab.

I was able to achieve an accuracy of 99.93% on the training set(60000 images) and an accuracy of 99.16% on the testing set(10000 images).
